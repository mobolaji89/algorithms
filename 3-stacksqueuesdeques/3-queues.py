# Queues

"""
A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items
happens at one end, called the "rear," and the removal of existing items
occurs at the other end, commonly called the "front."

As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward
the front, waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.

The most recently added item in the queue must wait at the end of the
collection.

The item that has been in the collection the longest is at the front.
This ordering principle is sometimes called FIFO, first-in first-out.

It is also known as "first-come first-served."

The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in
from time to time.

We wait in line for a movie, we wait in the checkout line at a grocery store,
and we wait in the cafeteria line.

The first person in that line is also the first person to get serviced/helped.
